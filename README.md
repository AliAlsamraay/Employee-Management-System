# Employee Management System (REST API)

The Employee Management System is a web-based REST API developed using Spring Boot and Java. 
It provides a platform for managing employee information, including creating, updating, and deleting employee profiles. 
The API also allows for managing attendance records, leave requests, and performance evaluations. 
User authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to secure the system, and role-based access control is enforced. 
Additionally, the API generates reports for employee performance, attendance, and other relevant metrics.
